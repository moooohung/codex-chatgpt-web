# Long-session admission, recovery and CoS

The Responses and MCP request formats are unchanged. A parsed request is admitted once;
its body, parsed context, model, effort and compaction flags are captured alongside the
trusted execution environment. Execution rejects a changed request with HTTP 400
`turn_preflight_changed`. A thread-only cache entry is not current-turn authority.

Native checkpoint source instructions and post-checkpoint instructions remain separate
authenticated sequences. Incomplete native JSONL writes are different from conflicting
identity, permissions or instructions. Admission watches the validated native journal and
performs at most three reads over a one-second waiting budget. If the write remains
incomplete, HTTP 503 `native_snapshot_not_ready` and `Retry-After: 1` arrive before adapter
creation or SSE. Complete conflicting records retain their non-retryable validation errors.
Reading and validation time is additional to the waiting budget. Cancellation closes the
watcher; a subsequent attempt authenticates the current journal again.

Desktop Play after an app/switcher restart can open a new native turn while keeping the
original human instruction. Admission authenticates the exact instruction id, content,
old task boundary and environment, and the current open task/context in the native
journal. An unfinished old task can hand off to the new turn without a synthetic
"continue" message. Completed/cancelled tasks, unrelated failures, newer instructions,
foreign owners and replaced checkpoints cannot supply this evidence. A prior Play
rejected by this bridge's exact structured turn-revision validation error may be retried;
other validation failures remain terminal. Partial appends use the same bounded 503
admission as checkpoint recovery. This evidence is request-scoped and survives no body
or instruction substitution. The authenticated old browser/capability is retired and
physical cleanup completes before one replacement can start with the new native owner.

The existing turn registry remains the browser execution owner. Reconnection replays its
event journal and queued tool batch, and physical retirement gates replacement work.
HTTP disconnect does not become user cancellation. A native stop or superseding instruction
retires the capability. Browser submission and tool invocation are not recovery actions.

A failed Responses stream write detaches only that observer, including ordinary
`AbortError`, Node `ABORT_ERR`, and a closed stream that has not yet raised its close signal.
Heartbeats cannot throw an uncaught stream exception into the daemon. Exact reconnection
replays the journaled text and tool batch against the existing browser; it does not submit
another ChatGPT message or deliver an already accepted tool result again. Execution and
validation failures outside the stream callback retain their terminal behavior.

`response_observer_detached` distinguishes transport loss from `response_round_failed`.
The latter records the processing stage, submission phase, outstanding tool count and
fixed error classifications. `broker_retired` identifies owner cancellation, MCP release,
tool timeout, expiry or shutdown. Error messages, stacks, request bodies, capability tokens
and arbitrary error names/codes are excluded from these diagnostic records.

Browser response verification remains append-only. Cosmetic DOM wrappers, code toolbars,
formula hydration and virtualized owned nodes are normalized. Delivered content, ordered
source ranges and link destinations cannot be rewritten. React state is consulted only
under a response with exactly one explicit message ID and a matching assistant message;
unknown, foreign or contradictory private state is ignored. It cannot bypass a running
generation or the visible completion controls. The requested effort is never downgraded,
and same-origin navigation alone is not proof of owned-conversation continuity.

## Optional CoS features

`cos-settings.json` in the selected runtime profile accepts:

```json
{
  "outputLimit": true,
  "observeWindow": true,
  "goalLoop": true,
  "dashboard": true,
  "dashboardPort": 17842
}
```

Defaults are false; development and custom profiles do not inherit production settings.
The build ships `WindowCapture.cs` beside `cli.js`. On Windows, `observe_window` claims the
current MCP turn before invoking an asynchronous, cancellable Windows PowerShell helper.
Text output is bounded by a shared UTF-8 byte budget while retaining both ends; images,
structured results and metadata retain their contracts. Screenshot files remain in the
profile's `captures` directory.

DEV interactive chat enables goal repetition only for a direct `[goal]`, `[목표]`, `/goal`,
`#goal` or `goal:` command. The normal native Codex goal scheduler retains ownership of
native tasks; CoS does not submit synthetic instructions to desktop chats. External
verification and local fallback use one durable 30-additional-dispatch budget. Explicit
new instructions, cancellation and completion discard pending replies. Restart restores
the consumed budget but never an active goal or queued follow-up. Repeating the same
objective does not reset its budget. An optional HTTPS evaluator uses `evaluatorEndpoint`
and `evaluatorModel`; its credential is read from `secrets/cos-evaluator-key`, outside Git.
No credential, token or message body is emitted in diagnostic events.

The dashboard binds only to loopback. It shows runtime health, aggregate token usage,
explicit goal status and a bounded event list. Goal-stop requests require the exact host,
same Origin and JSON content type. Model/account data is never interpolated as HTML.
Dashboard failure does not stop the core runtime. No external home-directory modules or
self-patching watcher are required.

## Launcher recovery and responsiveness

Repeated identical browser progress keeps updating the owner lease without publishing a
new renderer state more often than every five seconds, keeping freshness indicators live.
Real stage/tool-count changes still publish immediately. Renderer log
delivery batches every 100 ms with a 300-record backlog. This bounds render work during
large tool-output bursts without altering persisted logs.
Log rows retain stable keys as new records arrive. Full runtime installation and SHA-256
verification run in Node workers. Each process start performs a fresh full verification;
the main event loop stays responsive and same-size dependency corruption still fails.
No integrity cache or renderer Node integration is introduced. Stopping during verification
prevents the delayed child from being started after shutdown.

Chromium debugging switches are configured synchronously before startup yields to a
worker. Chromium allocates the loopback debugging port; startup reads the current
profile's fresh `DevToolsActivePort` record and checks its browser websocket identity.
The owned primary page must also appear in the CDP target inventory before runtime
startup. A missing endpoint fails startup instead of advertising an unusable browser.
Packaged smoke connects to the owned page websocket, navigates an isolated data document
and reads its marker through CDP; it never opens ChatGPT or sends a prompt.

Daemon and tunnel recovery track consecutive failed attempts independently of the existing
60-second burst limit. Five failed recoveries open the circuit even if attempts take more
than a minute. Fully successful recovery clears its budget; explicit startup/Repair also
grants a fresh budget. Failure publishes the last redacted reason. Background retries do
not silently reopen the circuit.

## Installation evidence

Before integrated installation, preserve both runtime directories, launcher archive,
profile configuration and original CoS modules. Build with the version pinned in
`package.json`, verify every manifest SHA-256 and resolved path, and smoke-test in isolated
homes without ChatGPT prompts. Install only after HTTP and browser work are both idle,
including pending owner cleanup. Launcher, daemon and MCP must move together. Validate
both installed manifests, process ownership, health and tunnel readiness; restore the
preserved installation on failure. Active work leaves a prepared candidate pending.

Offline fixture tests, builds and hashes are not evidence that a user's resumed Web task
succeeded. That result must be observed separately after the user resumes it.

## Native command polling and timeout causes

The tunnel's command-response deadline and the Responses silence budget are separate.
MCP invocations retain their 90-second transport deadline. A native `write_stdin` wait
of 120 or 300 seconds cannot finish inside it, even while ChatGPT is generating and its
browser heartbeat remains healthy. The 60-second response diagnostic does not terminate
the turn; a `tool_timeout` retirement does. Browser descriptor updates also occur when
a released tab is removed and are not evidence of a spontaneous surface replacement.

Native `write_stdin` and exec-cell `wait` calls therefore shorten `yield_time_ms` above
30 seconds before dispatch. This applies to dedicated MCP tools, exact inventory calls,
nested gateway calls and the registry passed to raw native exec. The native session/cell,
input characters, output limits and cancellation arguments remain unchanged. A poll
returns its native running result; further polls use that same session or cell. No
command is restarted or automatically replayed. Runtime inventory descriptions explain the bound;
existing request shapes and shorter polling intervals stay supported. Vendor tools with
similar names are not modified. Raw exec authors must return between polls rather than
accumulating many sequential waits within one MCP invocation.
The public MCP tools/list contract remains unchanged so cached connectors need no refresh.

Actual missing results or cancellation still retire an abandoned capability. If its
browser helper then reports a generic AbortError over IPC, the daemon preserves its
authenticated `codex_tool_timeout` reason in the settled browser outcome and journal.
It does not infer a cause from user text or replace unrelated browser errors.

# Account security checks and submission failures

Each account partition observes its own ChatGPT responses. A `403` with
`cf-mitigated: challenge` blocks new work on that account without changing its
login cookies or another account. An idle sign-in tab may refresh once; running
work and retained conversations are never refreshed. A persistent challenge is
reported in the tab and requires the user to complete the normal browser check.
An unrelated successful backend response does not establish recovery.

An initial new-document challenge preserves the same page for up to 45 seconds
so normal browser verification can finish. It does not reload or activate challenge
controls. A visible composer, the requested new-chat URL, and one authenticated
session check are required before prompt attachment. Cancellation still ends the
wait immediately. An unresolved check returns `chatgpt_security_check_required`;
a signed-out session returns `chatgpt_sign_in_required`.
A rejected current conversation POST or a visible error in the
accepted user group returns `chatgpt_submission_failed` without waiting for an
assistant that will never appear. Historical errors and quoted message content
do not reject the current turn. These failures are terminal for the exact trace;
an automatic Responses replay returns HTTP 400 before constructing another
browser. The user can resume with a new instruction after resolving the account
error. No Retry button or model fallback is activated automatically.
